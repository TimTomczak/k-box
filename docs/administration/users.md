# Users management

## Account types

The K-Box user management is based on [permissions](./permissions.md). 
To facilitate the user creation the permissions are grouped into four roles:

1. Guest: Can preview and download files. Has access only to the "Shared with me" page
2. Partner: Is based on Guest and additionally upload, edit and share files. Has access to shared Projects and Personal space
3. Project Manager: Can manage projects and publish (or unpublish) data to the K-Link
4. K-Box Administrator: Has all permissions and can manage users and the K-Box configuration

> For all the available permissions, please refer to the [Permissions List](./permissions.md)
