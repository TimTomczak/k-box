### Updated Logo

We started the process of improving the perception of the K-Box as a service of K-Link and not the K-Link itself.

To this aim, we decided to use the official K-Box logo mark and logotype.
You will see these changes in the icon on the browser tab and in the logo presented on the top left corner of the user interface.

### New login layout

It was time to give a fresh look to the first page that new and returning visitors are seeing: the login page.

The new layout maintain the right alignment of the login form, but uses a new container structure for the image.

The password recovery page and the user registration form also uses the new layout.

### User Registration

Administrators of a K-Box can now accept new usersâ€™ registration.
This is an opt-in option and is not active by default.

When enabled visitors will see a "Register" link on the login page.
The only required information are an E-Mail address and a password.
The newly created account will have a Partner role.

### E-Mail verification

To improve security we are introducing an E-Mail verification procedure. The verification consists in an email that contain a "Verify" link that the user should click.
In this way, we can ensure that the E-Mail address exists.

We enforce E-Mail verification in the following cases:

- New user registration using the public user registration
- When changing password and email from the user profile page


### Other notable changes

- Improve empty states iconography
- Sharing to mail opens in new tab by default
- Allow changing the language of a document to "no language recognized"
- Ensure pagination is visible on the recent page

_If you are a developer or you maintain a K-Box installation, please have a look at the [changelog](../../changelog.md) for a complete list of changes._

### Upgrade

The version include changes at the database level. 
We recommend having a full database backup before doing the upgrade.

Version 0.26 deprecated the guest user creation.
This version do not allow creating new guests users.
Existing guest users will continue to work.
