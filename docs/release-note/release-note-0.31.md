## Dialog improvements 

In this release we introduce a redesigned sharing dialog and 
a new create collection dialog. 

This new dialogs are mobile friendly and offer improved 
interactivity.

## Personalization of login/registration image

Login and registration screens shows an image on large displays. In this
version the image can be configured.

The configuration is controlled via variables and you can opt-in for:

1. using an image or
2. use a solid color fill.

The image can be hosted on any third party service. The K-Box will take 
care on downloading it on startup. The image will always be delivered
by the K-Box to respect users privacy.

## Other improvements and fixes

- Fixed documents being editable by more users than allowed
