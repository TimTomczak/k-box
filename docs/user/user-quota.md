# User Storage Quota

Each user in the K-Box can have unlimited or fixed amount of space for their files.

## Configuration

Please refer to the [Storage](../administration/storage.md) and [User](../administration/users.md) administration for quota configuration.

## How the used quota is calculated

The used quota is calculated by taking into account only the files added by the specific user to the K-Box.

For example adding a file to your uploads count on your quota, as well as adding a new version on any file that you can access.

Thumbnails and eventual additional file processing **do not** count on your used storage space.

## Notifications

You will be notified when the configured threshold is reached and when the used storage space is above or equal to the 99%.

Each notification will be sent only once.
